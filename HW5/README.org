To generate the data files and images in the [[file:output]] directory run
the following:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make
gfortran -fdefault-real-8 -Wall -O3  -c  main.f03
gfortran -fdefault-real-8 -Wall -O3  main.o -o main

$ ./main
dt=0.0100, dt/dx**2=1.00
  [WARNING] stability criterion violated (dt/dx**2>=0.5)
> gnuplot -e "data='output/dt_0.010.txt';dt=0.010" ./gnuplot/plot.plt
  [OK]


dt=0.0020, dt/dx**2=0.20
> gnuplot -e "data='output/dt_0.002.txt';dt=0.002" ./gnuplot/plot.plt
  [OK]
#+END_EXAMPLE

The slightly rearranged stability criterion is ~dt/dx**2 <
1/(alpha*2)~ with ~alpha = 1~ in this case. As can be seen in the
output above, this stability criterion was violated when the timestep
was set to ~0.01~. Thus no wonder the corresponding plot shows
instability in the form of exponentially growing oscillations.

Note the differences in the scale of the vertical axes in the plots
below.
