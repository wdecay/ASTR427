* General notes
The code follows the Fortran 2003 standard and can be found in the
~.f03~ files. It was tested using the ~GNU Fortran 9.3.0~ compiler on
Ubuntu. To build the code, run
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make
#+END_EXAMPLE
That will produce 3 executables called ~problem1~, ~problem2~ and
~problem3~.

* 1. Floating point representation
* 2. Roundoff error
* 3. Interpolation
